 * ProduceRequestResult类并未实现java.util.concurrent.Future接口
 * 但是其包含了一个count值为1的CountDownLatch对象,实现了类似Future的功能
 * <p>
 * 当RecordBatch中的全部消息被正常响,或超时,或关闭生产生产者时,会调用ProduceRequestResult.done()方法
 * 将produceFuture标记为完成,并通过ProduceRequestResult.error字段区分"异常完成"还是"正常完成",之后调用
 * CountDownLatch.countDown()方法,此时会唤醒阻塞在CountDownLatch对象的await()方法的线程(这些线程通过
 * ProduceRequestResult对象的await()方法等待上述三个事件的发生)
